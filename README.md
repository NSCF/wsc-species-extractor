## Extracting taxonomic information from the World Spider Catalog web pages

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION ###

Scripts for parsing information about names and synonyms directly from the pages of the WSC (as we don't have access to that all via the API or extracts as yet).

Intended to support setting up taxon backbone in a new database, or a first pass update of synonyms in an existing database. So it should only be used once. Thereafter, use the WSC updates API.
